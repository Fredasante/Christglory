                  God has miraculously dealt with me from last year till now and
                  I give Him all the praise. Getting to the end of 2022 I had
                  prayer requests concerning intimacy with God and I kept
                  praying<span class="moreText">
                    about it each time. It seemed I was rather becoming lazy
                    afterward and was just going about my normal activities.
                    Sometimes studying and praying becomes a challenge. About
                    two weeks till now I‚Äôve begun experiencing the power and
                    intimacy of the Holy Spirit in dreams and sometimes when
                    studying. This reminded me of ‚Äú in our weakness he‚Äôs our
